For example, a dataset containing marks of two subjects (i.e. features). It functions like normal summing method, but instead of calculating summation of each objects, AHP compares each objects in pairwise in determining the dominancy of the objects in each features. \r\n\r\n#Limitations\r\n\r\nThis automated AHP only works with ordinal features as pairwise comparison will be done automatically after each features are normalized.\r\n\r\n#Usage\r\n\r\nThe algorithm requires three kind of data:\r\n- List of criteria (e.g. Coursework marks and Final marks)\r\n\r\n`$criteria =array (\"CW\",\"FINAL\");`\r\n\r\n- List of alternatives' id (e.g. Name1, Name2, ...)\r\n\r\n`$alternativeid = array(\"ID1\",\"ID2\",\"ID3\");`\r\n\r\n- List of alternatives' features\r\n\r\n`$alternative = array(`\r\n\t\t\t`array(\"27.5\",\"23.33\",\"22.5\"), //CW`\r\n\t\t\t`array(\"8\",\"14\",\"17.5\"), //FINAL`\r\n`);`\r\n\r\n#License\r\n\r\nThis library is released under the Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka license.
